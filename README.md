# Document-Authentication-Platform
For the implementation of our platform, we used Laravel for the design of the REST API (Back-End) and Flutter for the design of the user interface (Front-End) to which were added plugins such as TCPDF and FPDI for PDF generation, Laravel Sanctum for authentication, Simple QrCode for generating QR codes or even OpenSSL for certificate generation
